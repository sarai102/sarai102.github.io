          <h2>Laziness and Burnout: Labyrinth of the College Life</h2>
          <p class="mins">20 mins</p>
          <p class="description">
            Behind the scenes, it's difficult to juggle the work load and motivation as a college student. In this blog post, I went into detail about how difficult it is to keep the cool and carry out the work that has to be done as a full time college student. Deep down, we have all struggled with staying on top of it, but I want everyone to have the chance to change by getting to know themselves and their unique study needs. <a href= "https://medium.com/@saraica/laziness-and-burnout-labyrinth-of-the-college-life-

          This project exposes the reliance we as consumers have on social media. We rely on it to tell us what to buy, what to wear, even what movies to watch. The movie industry experienced a big shift since social media has taken off. This shift has changed the way movies are marketed, <a href= "https://soundcloud.com/user-787894886/the-grasp-of-social-media-on-the-movie-industry?si=4dfafb1852984eff9397c871d2b8f04b&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing"> I wonder what changes are yet to come... </a> </p>

            In this video, I introduce a popular Bolivian dish done my way. I wanted to introduce a simple dish that can be made quickly and with easy ingrediants. However, I wanted to share my twist with a traditional dish that is made more afforable and more simple. <a href= "https://youtu.be/sAgsVWi-hTs"> Enjoy!</a> </p>

            Cook Counseling Center has many resources and outside resources that can help get a student through their college experience while taking care of their mental, physical, and intellectual health. My favorite resource are the workshops they have throughout semester. One that is very importnat is the skills building such as cooking or dealing with anxiety and time management around exam time. Feel Free to make an appointment or browse the site just to familiarize yourself with the free resources.They personally helped me get through many trying times in my college experience. <a href="https://ucc.vt.edu/"> I highly recommend you check them out.</a> </p>
